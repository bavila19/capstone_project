# Scope
I am planning on building an app that contains two apis. The first one would be called plant facts, giving the user a detailed description of how to take care of the plant and showing if the plant is toxic to pets. The second page would be called my plants which would be full crud and I would like to implement a timer on the home page that would notify the user what plants need to be watered.

# User Stories
The user will open the app and be greeted by the home page, which will have a list of plants that may need to be watered along with a link that takes them to the plant. To navigate throughout the page the user will use the hamburger icon that will be on the right-hand side of the app. Once clicked the user will see 3 pages. The first is "Plant Facts", this page will contain a list of information about plants. The second will be "My Plants", which is where the user will be able to upload photos of their own plants and watering info. In "My Plants" the user will have full access to add, delete, and update plants. The third page will be the "About" page, which will contain info on the creator and the purpose of the app.
